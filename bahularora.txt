Hey all,

I am Bahul Arora, I am learning Ruby and Rails. Although I use git many times each day, I dont know much about it and resort to googling each time I get stuck. So it made a lot of sense for me to properly learn a tool which I use so much. I would like to thank Mr Talim and the Whole Ruby Learning for this wonderful opportunity.
